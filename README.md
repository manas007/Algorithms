# Algorithms
A repo for basic data structures and algos problems and their solutions. The solutions are in java and I have added comments for the code. 
If you want to contribute to this repo, please make sure that you classify the problem into some particular category such as Searching, Sorting, Connecting.. etc
so that it is easier to understand and track.

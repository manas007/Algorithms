# Algorithms
A repo for basic data structures and algos problems and their solutions.

The motive behind building this repo is simple, we understand the basic data structures and build them.
Then we use these data structures to solve some problems, and the steps to solving the problem is our algorithm. 

The solutions are in java and I have added comments for the code. 
If you want to contribute to this repo, please make sure that you classify the problem into some particular category such as Searching, Sorting, Connecting.. etc
so that it is easier to understand and track.
